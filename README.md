Summary:
---

Pewlett-Hackard and their "Silver Tsunami" is going to prove to be a challenge for the company. They only have 3% of those retiring that are eligible for the mentorship program under the 1965 parameter. In order to balance out the wave Pewlett-Hackard should look to using at least half of the 41,380 people retiring to mentor those eligible.
